                <p>Step into the cableless future with the best wireless chargers on this guide. You don't need to go hunting for the end of your USB-C or Lightning charger when you need to power up your phone, but instead leave your phone on a stand or pad and let the magic of magnetic induction do the work.</p>
<p>Take a look at our best wireless chargers below.</p>

<h1 id="1belkin-boost-charge-pro-3-in-1-wireless-charging-pad-with-magsafe">1.Belkin Boost Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe</h1>
<p><strong>Ther best wireless charger overall</strong></p>
<p>This three-in-one charging pad from Belkin is my current favorite wireless charger. It offers 15W MagSafe charging for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, as well as fast charging for the Apple Watch 7 and regular wireless charging in an AirPods-sized recess, meaning all my Apple mobile devices could charge simultaneously from a single charging brick. That brick comes included too, so I didn't have to go rooting around in a cupboard for one with the correct wattage.</p>
<p>The only thing holding this charger back from perfection is its price, which is quite high. Also, the use of MagSafe and the Apple Watch charging cradle means this isn't a great pick for Android users.</p>

<h1 id="2apple-magsafe-charger">2.Apple MagSafe Charger</h1>
<p><strong>The best wireless charger to get for your iPhone</strong></p>
<p>As an iPhone 14 owner, Apple's MagSafe charger made wireless charging ridiculously easy for me. The magnets built into the charger and the back of the phone mean the two easily snap together and start the charging process.</p>
<p>You can charge at up to 15W on most iPhone 12, iPhone 13 or iPhone 14 models if you have a 20W charging plug at the other end, which fortunately I do. However, if you own an iPhone 12 mini or iPhone 13 mini, then that's limited to 12W. That's still faster than basic Qi wireless charging though, and it remains just as convenient no matter which model you own.</p>
<p>Although my AirPods don't have magnets in the back, I was still able to charge them fine with the MagSafe puck. It will be even easier if you own a newer pair of AirPods Pro though, which now comes with a MagSafe-ready charging case. If you're a diehard Apple fan, this is probably the wireless charger for you.</p>

<h1 id="3pitaka-magez-slider-2">3.Pitaka MagEZ Slider 2</h1>
<p><strong>The best wireless charger for versatility</strong></p>
<p>It's fun just to play with the MagEZ Slider2, since the spinning mechanism that allows the stand to face any direction makes a satisfying clicking sound as it moves. But lock the stand in place and you've got a cleverly designed charging stand that's ideal for users wanting to power up their phone and several accessories in a limited amount of space.</p>
<p>The main iPhone charging section only powers your phone at 7.5W rather than the full 15W, but it's also a removable 4,000 mAh power bank in case you need a little extra juice on the move. The rear charging panel has a magnetically adjustable stand to help you charge your earbuds in the optimum position, plus there's another USB-C output for charging other devices. Keep in mind though that the &quot;Power Dongle&quot; accessory that you need to charge your Apple Watch is not sold with the standard version of the charger. If you need a space for your Apple wearable on the Slider2, make sure you buy the more expensive version that comes with it included.</p>
