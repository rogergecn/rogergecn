                <p>The best keyboards are worth having in your home office, even if a laptop is your primary work machine.</p>
<p>Our picks for the best keyboards, on the other hand, are comfortable to type on even for extended periods, helping you get more done with less strain. You probably know from working at home that dropping a laptop on a desk and using the built-in keyboard is a recipe for hunched shoulders and cramped fingers.</p>
<p>Read on for our thoughts on the best keyboards you can buy, whatever your situation.</p>

<h1 id="1logitech-k780">1.Logitech K780</h1>
<p>Your laptop isn't the only device you need to type on, so Logitech has keyboards like the K780 that nimbly jump between up to three devices. It also supports Logitech's FLOW technology for easily moving data between computers. That's right: If you're using two different machines, this keyboard can copy a file from one and send it to the other.</p>
<p>Also, it's got circular keycaps, which will attract some people seeking a particular look, and maybe send others searching for other entries. If you're typing around family and friends, note that its keys are designed for a quieter typing noise, so you're less likely to irritate others.</p>
<p>This keyboard supports Mac, PC and Chrome OS using a trick Logitech calls OS Adaptive keyboard layout, where the keys adjust to the computer you're using. A slot at the far side of the keyboard allows you to dock your phones or tablets when you switch from your laptop to your phone.</p>

<h1 id="2apple-magic-keyboard">2.Apple Magic Keyboard</h1>
<p>Apple users should start here because this keyboard isn't just designed for their needs, it matches them. The Magic Keyboard is one of the best keyboards because it's a step up from the keyboards in the MacBooks made between 2016 and 2019, and it's pretty similar to the well-reviewed 16-inch MacBook Pro's keyboard â€” using a reliable scissor-switch mechanism and not the controversial butterfly-switch design.</p>
<p>The Magic Keyboard is one of the smaller keyboards in this set, making it much easier to throw in your bag or use at a small desk. Apple also makes the Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, which has a full number pad if you're OK with the larger size and do a lot of number-crunching. Both models feature a keyboard layout designed for use with Mac, making this one of the best picks on this board. It connects over Bluetooth.</p>

<h1 id="3logitech-ergo-k860">3.Logitech Ergo K860</h1>
<p>Looking for an ergonomically-friendly keyboard that works with more than just your laptop? The Logitech Ergo K860 is a great choice, and its split-keyboard design is meant to help you keep your hands in place to reduce strain.</p>
<p>One of our favorite features on the keyboard is the feet towards the front side of the chassis so you can change the height of the deck of the keyboard. For those of us with standing desks, that's a crucial difference maker as we're often moving between sitting and standing, which changes where our arms hit the table.</p>
<p>The Logitech Ergo K860 works over both Bluetooth and Logitech's own USB receiver for ultimate compatibility. Three device-pairing keys let you easily switch between paired devices.</p>
